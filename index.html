    <h2>I will not study the web only in theory(What I thought while reading 300 pages out of 600)</h2>
    <p> While studying the 600-page JavaScript book, I didn't realize that my skills were improving now.
    <br>While reading the book, I didn't think I could make a line of web code. I felt something was wrong, looked up YouTube, and tried googling.
    <br>So, I realized that I should study mainly on practical skills. I bought a practice-oriented HTML book right now, and this website was created after reading the book.
    <br>What I felt while doing it was more fun and rewarding to see the results in my eyes.
    <br>I plan to improve the quality of this website by reading many books in the future.</p>
