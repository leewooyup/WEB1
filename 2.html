    <h2>Preparing to become a web developer(What should I start with?)</h2>
    <p>Web development is divided into a front end and a back end.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:5px;">Front-end is a development field that operates on a web browser, which implements everything users see and interact with on a website.<br>
    It mainly focuses on creating a user interface (UI) and a user experience (UX).
    <br>The languages used in front-end development include HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    The technology used these days is ReactJS. It's a component-based open source library.
    It helps to create an excellent user interface.<br>
    (This technology has been developed and maintained by Facebook)</p>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Backend is a development field that operates on servers.<br> Load/manage data and create APIs that can be utilized.<br>
    It is possible to smoothly perform tasks performed by users at the front end.
    Languages used in backend development include PHP, Javascript, java, C++, and Python.Among them,
    Node.js is a runtime environment that allows Javascript code to be executed outside the browser.
    Nodes are used to develop backend services such as mobile or web applications API.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:20px;">I wanted to be a full stack developer who can encompass both the front and back ends.
    <br>Because I had a passion for learning, I wanted to understand the principles of motion in the two development fields.
    <br>The two began to study Javascript language. (Of course, I studied with html)</p>
