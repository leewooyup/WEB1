    <h2> A pitiful hedgehog (I failed)</h2>
    <p>It's a pity that a poor hedgehog <strong><u>failed</u></strong>.
    Hedgehogs dig near fields. I was immersed in digging and dug deeper than others.
    <br>But I didn't know that, and I was worried that there might be a hedgehog that dug deeper.
    <br>The fact that his tunnel was deep enough was gradually obscured by the suspicion of hedgehogs.
    <br>The hedgehog is buried in its own consciousness, and it is revealed by the hedgehog's expression.</p>
    <p>What a poor hedgehog!!!!!!!!!!</p><p style = "margin-top:5px;"><img src="hedgehog.jpg" width = "100%"></p><p style = "margin-top:40px;">Since then, hedgehogs have become poor hedgehogs.<br> The deeply dug tunnel was left unattended as if it had no more value,
    and in this emptiness, the poor hedgehog begins to put up thorns. It collapses in regret.<br> I couldn't admit it, and I think it's over.</p>
