    <h2> Outback server - peter (It's already been two years)</h2>
    <p> I worked at Outback Steakhouse for two and a half years. I, who is often stuttered, chose a part-time job that talks a lot to fix my teeth, and that was the outback.
    <br>At first, I went in to do it only for a month, but it's already been two years since I worked because I thought I shouldn't burden my parents with money anymore.
    <br>When I first entered, I wanted to make my nickname milo.(The name of the main character of the book "Paper Girl" that I liked at the time)
    <br>But this nickname doesn't stick to my mouth, so I was recommended to use Peter, and I'm Peter.
    <br>Because of COVID-19, I went to college face-to-face for the first time in a year, and from the second grade, I went to college face-to-face.It turned out...
    <br>I was depressed because I couldn't meet people, but the outback replaced it.
    <br>Instead of dating people in college, I started dating people in Outback, and I satisfied my desire in this area.
    <br>And he became the fourth part-timer to attend for a long time.</p>
